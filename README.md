# Hubbard Diagonalization
A program to diagonalize the Hamiltonian matrix for the Hubbard Hamiltonian and compute observables over a range of chemical potentials. This is part of my research with the Quantum Many Body Systems Group at Harvey Mudd College.

Please check out [the wiki](https://github.com/eibarragp/HubbardDiagonalization/wiki) for more information on both usage instructions and the theory behind the code!
